<h3>Portfolio Defined</h3>



<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Portfolio</span> - A collection of stuff</p>

<p>That&apos;s right, a portfolio in and of itself is nothing remarkable.&#xA0; The real value of a portfolio is what you do with that collection of stuff.</p>

<p>The intent of Foliotek Presentation is to help you take your &quot;stuff,&quot; organize it, and share it in a variety of ways.&#xA0; That could be with a potential employer to help you secure that dream job.&#xA0; It could be to showcase work you have
    done in school to your parents.&#xA0; It may even be used in your classroom as an experiential&#xA0;based learning project.&#xA0; Whatever the reason for sharing your &quot;stuff,&quot; Foliotek Presentation helps you showcase that &quot;stuff&quot;
    in a unique and creative way.</p>

<p>&#xA0;</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you are a teacher wanting to use portfolios in the classroom or an individual wanting to get a leg up on the competition by creating a professional online identity, Foliotek Presentation can help you accomplish your presentation
    objectives.

<h3>Uses for a Presentation Portfolio</h3>

<p>There are a number of valuable ways you can use a presentation portfolio, each having its own unique purpose.&#xA0; Below are a few we know of and have seen effectively&#xA0;used by a wide variety of institutions and individuals.</p>

<p>&#xA0;</p>

<ul>
    <li><span>RESUME SUPPLEMENT</span>
        <br> Everyone knows that you have to send in your resume to get a job, but what is going to set you apart from the other 200 resumes the HR rep has to sift through?&#xA0; Creating a presentation portfolio that contains real &quot;stuff&quot; you&apos;ve
        done can push you to the top of the interview list.</li>
</ul>

<p>&#xA0;</p>

<ul>
    <li><span>CAPSTONE PROJECT</span>
        <br> For a large number of degree programs at various higher education institutions, a capstone project is required.&#xA0; Why not synthesize all of your work into one electronic&#xA0;portfolio to present to your professor or committee once you have
        completed the project?
    </li>
</ul>

<p>&#xA0;</p>

<ul>
    <li><span>ONLINE IDENTITY</span>
        <br> We are sure you have a Facebook account and you probably have a twitter account, maybe even a LinkedIn account or Google+ account.&#xA0; You may even have a blog.&#xA0; Each of these identities has created an online persona for you.&#xA0; Why
        not simplify who you are and create a base landing page for your identity?&#xA0; By using Foliotek Presentation, you can create a portfolio of work that links to all of your other identities&#xA0;(if you want) but allows you to have a single focus
        for your online persona.</li>
</ul>

<p>&#xA0;</p>

<ul>
    <li><span>SCRAPBOOK</span>
        <br> Because Foliotek Presentation allows for all types of files storage, there is no limitation on what you could include in a scrapbook.&#xA0; Use Foliotek Presentation as your main online files repository so you can store and access files wherever
        you go.
    </li>
</ul>
