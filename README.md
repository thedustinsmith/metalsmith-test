Testing out metalsmith

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thedustinsmith/metalsmith-test.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thedustinsmith/metalsmith-test)


## Metalsmith Editor 
I'm calling this a metal smith editor, but really it's any kind of static site editor since it uses javascript to convert a specified selector into a contenteditable.


## Still To Do
* Source mode - edit the html directly
* Provide a link to the github file or the github repo to add a new page.
* Ability to add a new page


## Known Issues
* Wysihtml5 doesn't support inline styles - a lot of the demo pages in this repo have inline styles
