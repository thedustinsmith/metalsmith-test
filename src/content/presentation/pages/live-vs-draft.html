    Understanding the difference between Live and Draft pages is very important.&#xA0; Basically, draft pages are pages you are working on and cannot be seen by anyone but you.&#xA0; Live pages are ones you have shared and can be seen by anyone you
    <a

        your portfolio with.&#xA0; To see your Live and Draft pages, click on the Pages tab.</p>

<h3>Live Pages</h3>

<p>Live pages are pages that have been shared with others.&#xA0; The list of your Live pages appears on the right side of the Pages area.&#xA0; Only these pages are visible to anyone with whom you have shared your portfolio.&#xA0; In order to make pages
    &quot;live&quot; you must first share your portfolio <a href="/presentation/sharing" target="_blank" title="Sharing">privately, publicly, or in a

community</a>.&#xA0; Once a portfolio has been shared, you must have at least one live page.&#xA0; If you wish to remove all live pages, you must completely unshare your portfolio.</p>

</p>

<h3>Draft Pages</h3>

<p>Draft pages are pages that have been created but are not yet being shared in your portfolio.&#xA0; You can do this to begin working on a new page and keep it from view until you are finished with it.&#xA0; The Draft pages appear in the list to the left
    of the Pages area. The Draft pages list contains any pages you have created, whether they are shared or not; it can even include pages you have deleted.</p>

</p>

<p>&#xA0;</p>

<p>In the Draft pages section, you can share a page you have created, copy an existing page, or delete pages.&#xA0; When you are finished with a Draft page, remember to save it and then &apos;merge w/shared&apos; to make it live.</p>

<h3>Saving the Changes</h3>

<p>Once you have made the desired changes, be sure to click the &apos;Save&apos; button in the upper right corner to keep the changes you have made.</p>
